# This is an example configfile for gnarwl(_MAN_SEC_) v_VER_, listing every
# available directive. Empty lines and lines beginning with a pound symbol
# are ignored by the software. Please keep in mind, that gnarwl uses a
# very basic parser for reading this file. Therefore some restrictions are
# put on the format:
#
# 1. Only whitespaces (no tabs) are allowed as delimeter between key and 
#    value(s).
# 2. Whitespaces can neither be escaped nor quoted.
# 3. Macros must be declared before use.
